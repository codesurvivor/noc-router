This project implements NoC deterministic, partically adaptive and fully adaptive routing algorithms.

booksim2.0 is used for high level simulation. 5 routing algorithms are implemented: 1, XY; 2, West-first; 3, Negative-first; 4, Odd-Even; 5, Neighbors-on-Path

VHDL is used as the HDL language. 3 routing algorithms are implemented: 1, XY; 2, West-first; 3, Odd-Even
