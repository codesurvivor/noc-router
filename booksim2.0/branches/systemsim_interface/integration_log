Makefile.include

soft link into the network directory

VPATH_include in makefile.include in systemsim directory:
network/booksim/:network/booksim/routers/:network/booksim/allocators/:network/booksim/arbiters/:network/booksim/networks/:network/booksim/power/

create directories in the systemsim/obj:
obj/network/booksim
obj/network/booksim/allocators
obj/network/booksim/routers
obj/network/booksim/arbiters
obj/network/booksim/newtorks
obj/network/booksim/power
Ok dear god, the directory structure convoluted

remove QT shit from booksim, comment out bgui.cpp

added a boosim_main.cpp file which replaces the old main file. Needed for all the global variables

source files needs to be cpp. rng files are c, and they include other .c files, fuck

need to integrate the lex and yacc generation into the makefile, in the maintime the pregenerated files are added to svn. So, need to copy config_tab.* into the directory.

Booksim network class conflicts with the remnant ruby code =\, BSNetwork replaces Network

Added BooksimWrapper.* and SStrafficmanager.* all the magic are in there.
