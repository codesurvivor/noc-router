# This is a helper script that performs a latency-throughput sweep.
#
# It takes a complete booksim commandline as its parameter.
#
# Example:
#
#  ./sweep.sh ./booksim configfile
#
# The script implicitly enables BookSim's 'print_csv_results' parameter; 
# result data can be gathered from standard output by grepping for lines that 
# start with "results:"; miscellaneous status information for the script 
# itself is printed out in lines that begin with "SWEEP: ".
