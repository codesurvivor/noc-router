softlink to ruby/network

add Makefile.include
    add *.cpp from the entire source directory including files in the subdirectories 
    make sure the vpath name is BOOKSIM_VPATH and src name is BOOKSIM_SRC_CPP
    add the subfolder paths to booksim_vpath separated by ":"

	 BOOKSIM=booksim
	 include=booksim/Makefile.include 
	 add booksim_vpath add booksim_src_cpp

everything has to be .C not .cpp

lex and yacc not working yet

dont' for get a put a blank line at the end of Makefile.include

comment out all the garnet/orion, you can keep the simple network, make sure Network::createNetwork still exist somwhere. This is because garnet calls their router Router lol


create a global variable for booksim in ruby/config/config.include

comment out all the booksim main files

rename main.C in booksim to booksim_main.C (object file conflict, lol)


Code modifications


create a new trafficmanager class

need to change Newtork to BSNetwork due to naming conflicts

added a gems net to flits

Need a way to customize vc assignment. Instead of just the 5 packet type, open up the number ofpacket types. Also with xyyx and adaptive routing the vc assignment is complicated.
