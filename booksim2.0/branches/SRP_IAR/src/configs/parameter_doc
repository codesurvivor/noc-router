General network parameters
default_channel_latency: channel latency of all channels for the fat tree topology
Injection/ejection port of the fattree has been set at 5 cycles. 
voq: Enable VOQ for routers
cut_through: use virtual cut-through instead of the default wormhole router
flow_size: traffic are created as "flows" or messages, this specifies the number of packets in each message. 1 to inf. 

ECN parameters
ECN: enable ECN
ird_reset_timer: number of cycles before increasing injection rate
ecn_buffer_threshold: threshold indicating the congestion of the next buffer
ecn_congestion_threshold:  threshold to indicate the congestion of the current buffer
ird_scaling_factor: inject rate increment
ecn_ird_increase: injection rate decrement (scaled by ird_scaling_factor)
ecn_ird_limit: 1/Minimum injection rate threshold




SRP paramters
hotspot_reservation: turn on SRP
expiration_time: TTL
res_vcs: number of speculative VCs
reservation_buffer_size_drop: if the down stream VC looks full, go ahead and drop the packet at the current router
reservation_spec_vc_size: Input buffer size of the speculative VC can be set independently
reservation_spec_off: Turn off speculative packets
reservation_always_succeed: grant packets always return starting time of -1
reservation_rtt: the reservaiton starting time is adjusted by the control packet latency
reservation_overhead_factor: \epsilon in the paper
fast_reservation_transmit: send the reservation ASAP when multiple flows are competing for injectinon
reservation_packet_threshold: minimum reservation flow size from the paper
reservation_chunk_limit: reservation granularity from the paper
fast_retransmit: Retransmit outstanding speculative packet once starting time has reached
reservation_queuing_drop: use only queuing delay when computing the TTL
reservation_spec_voq: enable VOQ for the speculative VC as well
reservation_tail_reserve: reservation for the next chunk in a large message is sent with the last packet instead of using another reservation packet


A lot of constants are listed in reservation.hpp

Sample test run takes about 2 minutes:
./booksim configs/resfast_config configs/ftree256 configs/uniform_config flow_size=4 injection_rate=0.5 sample_period=10000
