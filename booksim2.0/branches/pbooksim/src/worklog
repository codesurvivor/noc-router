find the TODOs 


2/12/2009

Added tid to router. Associate each router with a accessing thread.

Added a bool shared to channels indicating its shared status

Added a pthread_lock_t to each channel, only allocated/inited after setshared() is called 

a thread version of network methods has been added, the method invoke the objects where  tid == thread id.
--Readinputs
--internal step
--writeoutputs

Note, in router object, addinputchannel, addoutputchannel don't need locks even though they modify the channel objects. Because network is setup during the sequential phase of the program.

added lock calls to iq_router when accessing the channels. 

added timing recording to main

created a silly Ptrafficmanager....yeah...

added barrier and barrier init to ptraffic



2/18/2009

current plan: ptrafficmanger will inheriten most of the funcitons of trafficmanager. The two diverges at the _singlesim() below single sim all code will be replicated to be available to threads, e.g. newflit become newflitP that takes a thread id as the argument, retireflit becomes retireflitP that takes an extra thread id argument etc.

added a mergestats functions to the stat class. So we can merge the stats of the individual threads together. AND CLEARS THE DATA after the merge


yay its working -ish. The injection rate is screwed up, when I set to 20% it is actually 26%. We suspect the random generator is a synchronization point and the rand seed maybe fucked up. 50% speed up with 2 threads

rand_utils have been changed from crazy shit to using normal c rand functions. This fixed the injeciton problem. But there are comments somewhere why they wrote their own rand stuff, somethin about the c versions being crappy.... anyways

I never actually call the locks on the credit channels, this caused dead locks!!!

Working on the copy local to my home computer:

Barrier is taking up alot of time. But changing the barrier from 1 cycle to 9 cycles actually take longer time. There is a load imbalance? maybe. 

2/26/2009
Working on the copy local to my home computer:

Intelligently dividing the network into two halves, the number of shared channels reduced to very few (1/6th ish)

Baseline	89s
1t		115
2t		70s
4t		45s
8t		36s
16t		39s


=====================================================================



Operations that can not be easily modified to run concurrently are removed for now they are listed below to be added in later. 



TODO: neeed an intelligent way to divide the network, and espeicially how to tell if a channel need to be shared


TODO: a lot of assert false has been added because the function has been removed below


TODO: WTF is class_array do, and can it be instantiated in the local scope of the normal/batch injection methods. I have changed it to be local, but might need to undo this bullshit

functions removed:
--automatically set flit_watch to on (silly and don't really need it)
--does not record in_flight flits for checking in the retireflilt function and does not display remaining (cuz its in a map and I dono how to split that map between the threads)
--does not check total_in_flight
--does not monitor measured_in_flight
--only support ANY_TYPE flit type, so... don't use use_read_write = 1; in the config file
--no batched mode
--not draining the network after the simulation
--does not support class based arbitration
--removed deadlock counter (what does it do anyways?)

today stopped at normal injection method, still ocmpilesx
